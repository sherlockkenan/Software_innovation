Résumé parsers:

jobscan.co; simulates ATS on résumés?

http://www.resumehacking.com/ready-for-automated-resume-screening says the main firms that parse résumés for the main ATSs are:

Daxtra (used by Zoho)
BurningGlass
Sovren (claims that “60% of all resumes are processed by Sovren technology”); claims use by Google, Hired, CyberCoders, Talent, Kelly, Lever, Neogov, 
TextKernel
Trovix (acquired by Monster)
RapidParser

January 2018 thesis on résumé parsing:

Tests commercial and open-source parsers on a sample of real software-engineering résumés, wrt NLU and structure recognition. Finds they ignore structure and parse only text, poorly.

Comments given to RapidParser, 2018-04-23:

I compliment you on your generosity in allowing the public to test résumés with RapidParser. Sovren also does this, but all the other commercial parsers that I have visited seem not to allow it.

My first test was on a résumé written for a human reader in a colloquial (rather than outline) style. I provided an HTML file with WCAG-2-compliant markup, so that assistive technologies could parse the document structure. You can find a copy of that file at https://jpdev.pro/info/ . It was generated by the software at https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonresume-theme-a11y .

The result was problematic.

At the beginning, the parser interpreted my name as “Demo Github” instead of “Jonathan Pool”.

Education and work histories were intermixed, and items within them were inconsistently interpreted, despite consistent formatting.

I wish to continue testing while developing applications for generating parser-friendly résumés, based on the jsonresume standard. Your sandbox API will be very helpful for this.

The advice given by Sovren for making résumés compatible with its parser is helpful. I recommend that kind of documentation as an additional enhancement to your website.
